# Editor & IDE Recommendations

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience.

## Recommended Extensions

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Python
- Jupyter
- Docker
- GitLens

## Settings

- Enable format on save
- Use the workspace `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc` for consistent style

Other editors (PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.) are also supported. See their docs for project setup.
